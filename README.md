The zombies battle.
		The battle consists of up to 100 rounds.
		Each round: one zombie attacks the other.
		The zombie to attack is determined by which zombie can move first.
		If there is a movement tie, the zombie who did not move last shall move first.
		If there is a movement tie in the first round, zombie "a" shall move first.
		The battle contininues until one zombie is no longer unDead,
			in which case the surviving zombie wins.
		If all 100 rounds finish and both zombies survive,
			then the battle is a draw and the zombies become friends.
